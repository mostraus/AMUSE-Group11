## Topic: The survival of planetary systems in dwarf galaxy tidal streams
**Motivation**: Globular clusters and dwarf galaxies are tidally stripped; some stars with planets may end up in tidal streams.

**Question**: Can planets around stripped stars survive the tidal disruption and ejection into the Galactic halo?

**AMUSE use**: N-body for starâ€“planet systems embedded in cluster/dwarf potential + Galactic tidal field.

**Deliverables**: Survival fraction of planets vs. cluster mass, stream orbit, and initial planet distribution.

**Why interesting**: Connects exoplanet survival to galactic dynamics.
