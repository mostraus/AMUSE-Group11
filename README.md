# AMUSE-Group11
Code and Content regarding the AMUSE Project from Group 11

## Topic: The survival of planetary systems in dwarf galaxy tidal streams
Motivation: Globular clusters and dwarf galaxies are tidally stripped; some stars with planets may end up in tidal streams.
Question: Can planets around stripped stars survive the tidal disruption and ejection into the Galactic halo?
AMUSE use: N-body for starâ€“planet systems embedded in cluster/dwarf potential + Galactic tidal field.
Deliverables: Survival fraction of planets vs. cluster mass, stream orbit, and initial planet distribution.
Why interesting: Connects exoplanet survival to galactic dynamics.
